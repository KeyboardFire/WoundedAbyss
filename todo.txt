- Attribute the place where I got the AMAZING free tileset
- Add player movement:
    [1] Allow movement with arrow keys
    [2] "Collision detection" so player can't move onto objects
    [3] Allow movement with mouse and touch
- Add scrolling:
    [1] Fixed level size and let it overflow
    [2] Write a "scroll" function to move the viewport
    [3] Invoke "scroll" when player starts to move close to edges
- Store level data in file
    1. Figure out a format
    2. Use it
- requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval
- make touch in IE work with weird pointer event stuff
